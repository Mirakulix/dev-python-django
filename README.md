# Dev-Django-Lint-Template

This project template is designed to streamline Django development by integrating various linting and security tools. It ensures adherence to best practices and aids in maintaining high code quality standards.

## Features

- Comprehensive linting with Flake8, Black, isort, MyPy, and Pylint.
- Security checks with Bandit and Safety.
- Automated code formatting and import sorting.
- Continuous Integration setup with GitLab CI/CD.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Django 4.2

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r lint-requirements.txt
```

## Linting Tools

The project uses the following linting tools:

- **Flake8**: For checking code against coding style (PEP 8).
- **Black**: For automatic code formatting.
- **isort**: For sorting imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections.
- **MyPy**: For static type checking.
- **Pylint**: For more in-depth code analysis.
- **Bandit**: For identifying security issues in Python code.
- **Safety**: For checking dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

## GitLab CI Configuration

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file contains the CI pipeline configuration for running lint and security checks. It is designed to run these checks on merge requests and the master branch to ensure code quality before integration.

## Usage

To run the linting and security checks locally, you can execute the following commands:

- Flake8:

  ```bash
  flake8 .
  ```

- Black (check mode):

  ```bash
  black --check .
  ```

- isort (check mode):

  ```bash
  isort --check-only .
  ```

- MyPy:

  ```bash
  mypy .
  ```

- Pylint:

  ```bash
  pylint **/*.py
  ```

- Bandit:

  ```bash
  bandit -r .
  ```

- Safety:

  ```bash
  safety check
  ```

For automatic fixes with Black and isort, you can remove the `--check` and `--check-only` flags, respectively.
